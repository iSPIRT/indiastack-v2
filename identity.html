        <h2>Aadhaar Authentication</h2>
        <p>The entire point of the Aadhaar program is to seed the population with secure, versatile digital IDs that can be used to quickly authenticate a user’s identity. There are currently a variety of ways in which a petitioner can prove a user’s identity using Aadhaar:</p>

            <p class="description"> A petitioner sends a user’s Aadhaar number and name/address/birthday/gender/email/phone number to the UIDAI server, which responds with a yes/no answer indicating whether the given fields were correct</p>

            <p class="description">A petitioner collects consent (via biometric of two-factor OTP authentication) from a user and submits their Aadhaar number to the UIDAI system. The system then returns the user’s entire KYC data including all six demographic fields and the user’s photograph.</p>

            <p class="description">Each Aadhaar card comes with an accompanying QR code that can be scanned, allowing the scanner to verify the user’s identity from the UIDAI database. Both physical and digital Aadhaar cards (e-Sadhaar) can be scanned in this manner, from UIDAI-built iOS apps, Android apps, or Windows apps.</p>

            <p class="description">In this mode of authentication, the user visits the UIDAI website, logs in using his Aadhaar-registered mobile number or email address, and then generates an XML object containing a digital signature from UIDAI. This XML can then be shared with any party, which can easily verify the digital signature and prove the user’s identity. </p>

        <p>The utilities offered by Aadhaar can be used to build all kinds of identity workflows. For example, a developer could build a social media platform that only allows women users to sign up. In another case, an app could use e-auth to verify that the address field entered by a user is actually valid. </p>

        <p>The possibilities are manifold, and developers are encouraged to come up with novel ways to use this public digital infrastructure. Having said that, readers should be aware that e-auth and e-KYC services are only available to banks, telecom companies, and government bodies.</p>

        <p>Developers belonging to other organizations must use QR code scans, e-Aadhaar, or offline XML in order to prove a customer’s identity using Aadhaar.</p>

        <p>Here are some relevant resources about Aadhaar authentication services:</p>

          <p>eSign is a digital signature product built atop Aadhaar. It allows any Aadhaar holder to produce legally valid digital signatures on any document, at any time, using any device. Consent for this signature is obtained through a one-time password sent to the signer’s Aadhaar-linked mobile number.</p>
          <p>In order to gain access to the certified  eSign in their workflows, application developers must enroll as eSign Application Service Providers (ASPs).</p>
